				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
				Lions Clubs International (LCI) is an international secular,
				non-political service organization founded by Melvin Jones in 1917. 
				As of April 2015, it had over 46,000 local clubs and more than 1.4 
				million members in over 200 countries around the world. Headquartered 
				in Oak Brook, Illinois, United States, the organization aims to meet the
				needs of communities on a local and global scale.
				</p>
				<h4>Aims</h4>
				<p>
				The stated purposes of Lions Clubs International are:</br>
				&#8594 To Organize, charter and supervise service clubs to be known as Lions clubs.</br>
				&#8594 To Coordinate the activities and standardize the administration of Lions clubs.</br>
				&#8594 To Create and foster a spirit of understanding among the peoples of the world.</br>
				&#8594 To Promote the principles of good government and good citizenship.</br>
				&#8594 To Take an active interest in the civic, cultural, social and moral welfare of the community.</br>
				&#8594 To Unite the clubs in the bonds of friendship, good fellowship and mutual understanding.</br>
				&#8594 To Provide a forum for the open discussion of all matters of public interest; provided, however, that partisan politics and sectarian religion shall not be debated by club members.</br>
				&#8594 To Encourage service-minded people to serve their community without personal financial reward, and to encourage efficiency and promote high ethical standards in commerce, industry, professions, public works and private endeavors.</br>
				</p>
				<h4>International convention</h4>
				<p>
					An international convention is held annually in cities across the globe for members to
					meet other Lions, elect the coming year's officers, and partake in the many activities planned.
					At the convention, Lions can participate in elections and parades, display and discuss
					fundraisers and service projects, and trade pins and other souvenirs. The first convention 
					was held in 1917, the first year of the club's existence, in Dallas, Texas. The 2006 convention
					was due to be held in New Orleans, but damage sustained during Hurricane Katrina meant that
					the convention had to be relocated to Boston.
				</p>
				<h4>Conspiracy theories</h4>
				<p>
				The Lions have been accused of being involved in the "New World Order" plot, along with the Freemasons,
				for the supposed purpose of sabotaging societies and achieving Zionist interests. The most prominent 
				of these claims came from the thirty-four-article Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
				released in 1988, defining its goals, objectives, and world view. The Lions Clubs are mentioned twice 
				as a Zionist front, clearly perceived as an enemy of Islam.</p>
