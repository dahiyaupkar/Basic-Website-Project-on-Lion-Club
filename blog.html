				<h4>A Lion’s Secret to Social Media Success</h4>
				<p>Did you know two of the top five most visited websites are social media sites?
				In an average day, 4.5 billion likes are generated on Facebook! There’s no doubt 
				that Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, LinkedIn and other social media sites allow users 
				to connect with a wide audience, but in a sea of posts, how can your club get noticed? 				
			    One Lion found success in a social media campaign. He managed to grow his club from 21 
				members to 63 members in just one year. How did Zone Chairperson Jerhavon Pearman do it?
				According to Chairperson Pearman (District 18-I), the key to a thriving club is “the next generation.” 
				Everyone wants to attract younger members and bring them into their clubs, but you need to get 
				their attention, and nothing works for that like social media!

				<h4>LionsAIM Helps Children in Zambia</h4>
				<p>
					Lions AIM (Aid in Meeting) is an aid and cultural exchange program for members of student clubs
					and other young members of Lions Norway. AIM is working with several agencies and projects in Uganda
					and Zambia, where an annual student delegation offers a one-month field work program in June and 
					July as a part of the project. Today’s blog post is by Marie Lytomt Norum of Lions Club Trondheim 
					Student, who shares the students’ experiences: This summer, Aid in Meeting (AIM) sent a delegation
					of eight Norwegian students to work in Zambia for four weeks. AIM is an aid- and cultural programme 
					for the members of the student clubs of Lions Clubs International. During our stay in Zambia, 
					we met the people behind the organisations we wanted to cooperate with. Our aim has been to contribute
					to develop their projects in a sustainable way.

				<h4>Touchstone Story: United Nations</h4>
				<p>Lion Clubs International was one of the first nongovernmental organizations invited to assist in 
				drafting the U.N. Charter. Jones, International President D.A. Skeen of Salt Lake City, Utah, and 
				future International President Fred W. Smith of Ventura, California, helped to formulate the NGO 
				section of the charter and participated in developing the U.N.’s humanitarian mission. On June 26,
				1945, the U.N. charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries.
